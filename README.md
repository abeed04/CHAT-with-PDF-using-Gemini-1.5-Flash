This project enables users to engage in an informative and interactive conversation with the content of PDF documents using Gemini-1.5 Flash, a large language model (LLM) empowered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG enhances Gemini's ability to process and respond to your questions by leveraging external knowledge sources like PDF files.

Key Technologies:
<br>
-->Gemini-1.5 Flash: A powerful LLM from Google AI, trained on a massive dataset of text and code.
<br>
-->Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique that integrates external information retrieval into the LLM, allowing it to ground its responses in factual content from PDFs.
<br>
-->FIASS (Flexible Information Access System): (Potentially) A framework for information retrieval, likely used to manage and search within PDF documents. (If FIASS is not directly involved, remove this line.)
<br>
-->RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: A tool that breaks down text into smaller units for processing by the LLM.
<br>
-->Google Generative AI Embeddings: Pre-trained vector representations of text that can aid in information retrieval and similarity comparisons
